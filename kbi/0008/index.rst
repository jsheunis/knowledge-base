This knowledge base item describes how to remove a git annex from a DataLad
dataset and propagate that change to siblings


The scenario
------------

You have a DataLad dataset that has annexed files and you decide that you
don't want to use git-annex anymore in this dataset. This change should
also be propagated to all siblings of the dataset.


A few words of caution
......................

1. You should not remove the annex if you have large files, i.e. 1GB or larger, in your dataset. ``git`` is not intended for large files, which is the reason for the creation of ``git annex`` in the first place.

2. If you remove the annex, your files will be untracked in your dataset directory. That means, they are not versioned at this moment. If you don't follow the instructions in this knowledge base item precisely you might lose those files. Please be careful when you remove the annex! Work on a copy, or make sure that you have a sibling that contains your data. We do not want you to lose data.


Removing a git annex
--------------------

Go to the dataset from which you want to remove the git annex and save the current s

.. code-block:: console

    > cd my_dataset
    > datalad save


Now it is time to remove the annex. The command ``git annex uninit`` will perform this task. But it will leave the now un-annexed files as "untracked" in the dataset. If you want to keep their content, you **have** to make sure to add them to ``git`` before doing anything else. This can be done with a single ``git add .``-command in the root of the dataset, if your dataset is clean, i.e. does not contain other untracked files, that should not become part of the dataset content (if your dataset is not clean, you can add all files that want to keep individually with the command ``git add <file-name>``). Afterwards you should execute a ``datalad save``. So the next commands are:

.. code-block:: console

    > git annex uninit
    > git add .
    > datalad save

That is it, no more annex files in your local dataset copy. If you want to push this dataset to siblings, read on.


Pushing an un-annexed dataset to a sibling
------------------------------------------

Before you can push a freshly un-annexed dataset to a sibling that still has an annex, you have to delete the ``git-annex``-branch in the sibling. Afterwards you can push the un-annexed dataset to the sibling. All subsequent clones from the sibling will have no annexed data. The following two commands will delete the ``git-annex``-branch from the sibling and push the un-annexed dataset to the sibling (we assume that the siblings name is ``a_sibling``):

.. code-block:: console

    > git push a_sibling ":git-annex"
    > datalad push -f gitpush --to a_sibling


That is it. Your sibling will have no more annex either.
